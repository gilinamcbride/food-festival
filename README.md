## Description

This is a web application designed for a food festival so attendees can use the app on their phones to see the schedule of events, and buy tickets. The existing application has been optimized by minifying assets, adding offline functionality, and turning it into a Progressive Web Application following a course module on Google Lighthouse, webpack, Service Workers and PWAs.

## Additions

Additions made to the existing app:

- Measured performance metrics for the website using Chrome DevTool's Lighthouse app
- Performed audits to expose performance flaws which are especially critical when dealing with slower mobile devices on sluggish networks
- Used webpack to bundle assets through a dependency graph to optimize performance by lazy loading and minification
- Used service workers to cache the websites assets for offline functionality
- Offered installable icons for quick access to our app using PWAs
